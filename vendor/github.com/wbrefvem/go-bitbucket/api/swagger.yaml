  description: "Webhooks provide a way to configure Bitbucket Cloud to make requests\
    \ to\nyour server (or another external service) whenever certain events occur\
    \ in\nBitbucket Cloud.\n\nA webhook consists of:\n\n* A subject -- The resource\
    \ that generates the events. Currently, this resource\n  is the repository, user\
    \ account, or team where you create the webhook.\n* One or more event -- The default\
    \ event is a repository push, but you can\n  select multiple events that can trigger\
    \ the webhook.\n* A URL -- The endpoint where you want Bitbucket to send the event\
    \ payloads\n  when a matching event happens.\n\nThere are two parts to getting\
    \ a webhook to work: creating the webhook and\ntriggering the webhook. After you\
    \ create a webhook for an event, every time\nthat event occurs, Bitbucket sends\
    \ a payload request that describes the event\nto the specified URL. Thus, you\
    \ can think of webhooks as a kind of\nnotification system.\n\nUse webhooks to\
    \ integrate applications with Bitbucket Cloud. The following\nuse cases provides\
    \ examples of when you would want to use webhooks:\n\n* Every time a user pushes\
    \ commits in a repository, you may want to notify\n  your CI server to start a\
    \ build.\n* Every time a user pushes commits or creates a pull request, you may\
    \ want to\n  display a notification in your application.\n"

      description: "Endpoint to create and initiate a pipeline. \nThere are a couple\
        \ of different options to initiate a pipeline, where the payload of the request\
        \ will determine which type of pipeline will be instantiated.\n# Trigger a\
        \ Pipeline for a branch or tag\nOne way to trigger pipelines is by specifying\
        \ the reference for which you want to trigger a pipeline (e.g. a branch or\
        \ tag). \nThe specified reference will be used to determine which pipeline\
        \ definition from the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file will be applied to initiate\
        \ the pipeline. The pipeline will then do a clone of the repository and checkout\
        \ the latest revision of the specified reference.\n\n### Example\n\n```\n\
        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
        \ \\\n https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/\

        \     \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\", \n      \"ref_name\": \"master\"\n\
        \    }\n  }'\n```\n# Trigger a Pipeline for a commit on a branch or tag\n\
        You can initiate a pipeline for a specific commit and in the context of a\
        \ specified reference (e.g. a branch, tag or bookmark).\nThe specified reference\
        \ will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the bitbucket-pipelines.yml\
        \ file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will clone the\
        \ repository and then do a checkout the specified reference. \n\nThe following\
        \ reference types are supported:\n\n* `branch` \n* `named_branch`\n* `bookmark`\
        \ \n * `tag`\n\n### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password\
        \ \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/\

        \n      }, \n      \"ref_type\": \"branch\", \n      \"type\": \"pipeline_ref_target\"\
        , \n      \"ref_name\": \"master\"\n    }\n  }'\n```\n# Trigger a specific\
        \ pipeline definition for a commit\nYou can trigger a specific pipeline that\
        \ is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit.\
        \ \nIn addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of\
        \ the selector that identifies the pipeline definition. The resulting pipeline\
        \ will then clone the repository and checkout the specified revision.\n\n\
        ### Example\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \\\n  -H 'Content-Type:\
        \ application/json' \\\n https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/\

        \ in the context of a specified reference. \nIn addition to the commit revision,\
        \ you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline\
        \ definition, as well as the reference information. The resulting pipeline\
        \ will then clone the repository a checkout the specified reference.\n\n###\

      description: "Used to update a snippet. Use this to add and delete files and\
        \ to\nchange a snippet's title.\n\nTo update a snippet, one can either PUT\
        \ a full snapshot, or only the\nparts that need to be changed.\n\nThe contract\
        \ for PUT on this API is that properties missing from the\nrequest remain\
        \ untouched so that snippets can be efficiently\nmanipulated with differential\
        \ payloads.\n\nTo delete a property (e.g. the title, or a file), include its\
        \ name in\nthe request, but omit its value (use `null`).\n\nAs in Git, explicit\
        \ renaming of files is not supported. Instead, to\nrename a file, delete it\
        \ and add it again under another name. This can\nbe done atomically in a single\
        \ request. Rename detection is left to\nthe SCM.\n\nPUT supports three different\
        \ content types for both request and\nresponse bodies:\n\n* `application/json`\n\
        * `multipart/related`\n* `multipart/form-data`\n\nThe content type used for\
        \ the request body can be different than that\nused for the response. Content\
        \ types are specified using standard HTTP\nheaders.\n\nUse the `Content-Type`\
        \ and `Accept` headers to select the desired\nrequest and response format.\n\
        \n\napplication/json\n----------------\n\nAs with creation and retrieval,\
        \ the content type determines what\nproperties can be manipulated. `application/json`\
        \ does not support\nfile contents and is therefore limited to a snippet's\
        \ meta data.\n\nTo update the title, without changing any of its files:\n\n\
        \    $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj\
        \             -d '{\"title\": \"Updated title\"}'\n\n\nTo delete the title:\n\
        \n    $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj\
        \             -d '{\"title\": null}'\n\nNot all parts of a snippet can be\
        \ manipulated. The owner and creator\nfor instance are immutable.\n\n\nmultipart/related\n\
        -----------------\n\n`multipart/related` can be used to manipulate all of\
        \ a snippet's\nproperties. The body is identical to a POST. properties omitted\
        \ from\nthe request are left unchanged. Since the `start` part contains JSON,\n\
        the mechanism for manipulating the snippet's meta data is identical\nto `application/json`\
        \ requests.\n\nTo update one of a snippet's file contents, while also changing\
        \ its\ntitle:\n\n    PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Length:\

        \ It is\nderived from `name` by substituting non-ASCII characters, removes\n\
        whitespace, and changes characters to lower case. For example,\n`My repo`\
        \ would turn into `my_repo`.\n\n## Forking a repository into a team account\n\
        \nTo create a fork into a team account, specify the new owner's account\n\
        explicitly as part of the request body. This prevents forked\nrepositories\
        \ from being owned by the authenticated user submitting the\nrequest:\n\n\
        ```\n$ curl -X POST -u jdoe https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/forks\
        \ \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\n    \"name\": \"bbql_fork\"\
        ,\n    \"owner\": {\n      \"username\": \"atlassian\"\n    }\n}'\n```\n\n\
        To fork a repository into the same team, also specify a new `name`.\n\nYou\
        \ need contributor access to create new forks within a team account.\n\n\n\
        ## Change the properties of a new fork\n\nBy default the fork inherits most\
        \ of its properties from the parent.\nHowever, since the optional POST body\
        \ document follows the normal\n`repository` JSON schema and you can override\
        \ the new fork's\nproperties.\n\nProperties that can be overridden include:\n\
        \n* description\n* fork_policy\n* language\n* mainbranch\n* is_private (note\
        \ that a private repo's fork_policy might prohibit\n  the creation of public\
        \ forks, in which `is_private=False` would fail)\n* has_issues (to initialize\
        \ or disable the new repo's issue tracker --\n  note that the actual contents\
        \ of the parent repository's issue\n  tracker are not copied during forking)\n\
        * has_wiki (to initialize or disable the new repo's wiki --\n  note that the\
        \ actual contents of the parent repository's wiki are not\n  copied during\
        \ forking)\n* project (only teams have projects and when forking into a private\n\
        \  project, the fork's `is_private` must be `true`)\n\nProperties that cannot\
        \ be modified include:\n\n* scm\n* parent\n* full_name"

      description: "This endpoints is used to retrieve the contents of a single file,\n\
        or the contents of a directory at a specified revision.\n\n## Raw file contents\n\
        \nWhen `path` points to a file, this endpoint returns the raw contents.\n\
        The response's Content-Type is derived from the filename\nextension (not from\
        \ the contents). The file contents are not processed\nand no character encoding/recoding\
        \ is performed and as a result no\ncharacter encoding is included as part\
        \ of the Content-Type.\n\nThe `Content-Disposition` header will be \"attachment\"\
        \ to prevent\nbrowsers from running executable files.\n\nIf the file is managed\
        \ by LFS, then a 301 redirect pointing to\nAtlassian's media services platform\
        \ is returned.\n\nThe response includes an ETag that is based on the contents\
        \ of the file\nand its attributes. This means that an empty `__init__.py`\
        \ always\nreturns the same ETag, regardless on the directory it lives in,\
        \ or the\ncommit it is on.\n\n## File meta data\n\nWhen the request for a\
        \ file path includes the query parameter\n`?format=meta`, instead of returning\
        \ the file's raw contents, Bitbucket\ninstead returns the JSON object describing\
        \ the file's properties:\n\n```javascript\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests/__init__.py?format=meta\n\
        {\n  \"links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py\"\

        \n    }\n  },\n  \"path\": \"tests/__init__.py\",\n  \"commit\": {\n    \"\
        type\": \"commit\",\n    \"hash\": \"eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\
        ,\n    \"links\": {\n      \"self\": {\n        \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\
        \n      },\n      \"html\": {\n        \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335\"\
        \n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"attributes\": [],\n  \"type\": \"commit_file\"\
        ,\n  \"size\": 0\n}\n```\n\nFile objects contain an `attributes` element that\
        \ contains a list of\npossible modifiers. Currently defined values are:\n\n\
        * `link` -- indicates that the entry is a symbolic link. The contents\n  \
        \  of the file represent the path the link points to.\n* `executable` -- indicates\
        \ that the file has the executable bit set.\n* `subrepository` -- indicates\
        \ that the entry points to a submodule or\n    subrepo. The contents of the\
        \ file is the SHA1 of the repository\n    pointed to.\n* `binary` -- indicates\
        \ whether Bitbucket thinks the file is binary.\n\nThis endpoint can provide\
        \ an alternative to how a HEAD request can be\nused to check for the existence\
        \ of a file, or a file's size without\nincurring the overhead of receiving\
        \ its full contents.\n\n\n## Directory listings\n\nWhen `path` points to a\
        \ directory instead of a file, the response is a\npaginated list of directory\
        \ and file objects in the same order as the\nunderlying SCM system would return\
        \ them.\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests\n\

        : 2\n}\n```\n\nWhen listing the contents of the repo's root directory, the\
        \ use of a\ntrailing slash at the end of the URL is required.\n\nThe response\
        \ is not recursive, meaning that only the direct contents of\na path are returned.\
        \ The response does not recurse down into\nsubdirectories. In order to \"\
        walk\" the entire directory tree, the\nclient needs to parse each response\
        \ and follow the `self` links of each\n`commit_directory` object.\n\nEach\
        \ returned object is either a `commit_file`, or a `commit_directory`,\nboth\
        \ of which contain a `path` element. This path is the absolute path\nfrom\
        \ the root of the repository. Each object also contains a `commit`\nobject\
        \ which embeds the commit the file is on. Note that this is merely\nthe commit\
        \ that was used in the URL. It is *not* the commit that last\nmodified the\
        \ file.\n\nDirectory objects have 2 representations. Their `self` link returns\
        \ the\npaginated contents of the directory. The `meta` link on the other hand\n\
        returns the actual `directory` object itself, e.g.:\n\n```javascript\n{\n\
        \  \"path\": \"tests/test_project\",\n  \"type\": \"commit_directory\",\n\
        \  \"links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/\"\
        \n    },\n    \"meta\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta\"\
        \n    }\n  },\n  \"commit\": { ... }\n}\n```\n\n## Querying, filtering and\
        \ sorting\n\nLike most API endpoints, this API supports the Bitbucket\nquerying/filtering\
        \ syntax and so you could filter a directory listing\nto only include entries\
        \ that match certain criteria. For instance, to\nlist all binary files over\
        \ 1kb use the expression:\n\n`size > 1024 and attributes = \"binary\"`\n\n\
        which after urlencoding yields the query string:\n\n`?q=size%3E1024+and+attributes%3D%22binary%22`\n\
        \nTo change the ordering of the response, use the `?sort` parameter:\n\n`.../src/eefd5ef/?sort=-size`\n\
        \nSee [filtering and sorting](../../../../../../meta/filtering) for more\n\
        details."

        \nSnippets can contain multiple files. Both text and binary files are\nsupported.\n\
        \nThe simplest way to create a new snippet from a local file:\n\n    $ curl\
        \ -u username:password -X POST https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets    \
        \           -F file=@image.png\n\nCreating snippets through curl has a few\
        \ limitations and so let's look\nat a more complicated scenario.\n\nSnippets\
        \ are created with a multipart POST. Both `multipart/form-data`\nand `multipart/related`\
        \ are supported. Both allow the creation of\nsnippets with both meta data\
        \ (title, etc), as well as multiple text\nand binary files.\n\nThe main difference\
        \ is that `multipart/related` can use rich encoding\nfor the meta data (currently\
        \ JSON).\n\n\nmultipart/related (RFC-2387)\n----------------------------\n\

        \nThe request contains multiple parts and is structured as follows.\n\nThe\
        \ first part is the JSON document that describes the snippet's\nproperties\
        \ or meta data. It either has to be the first part, or the\nrequest's `Content-Type`\
        \ header must contain the `start` parameter to\npoint to it.\n\nThe remaining\
        \ parts are the files of which there can be zero or more.\nEach file part\
        \ should contain the `Content-ID` MIME header through\nwhich the JSON meta\
        \ data's `files` element addresses it. The value\nshould be the name of the\
        \ file.\n\n`Content-Disposition` is an optional MIME header. The header's\n\
        optional `filename` parameter can be used to specify the file name\nthat Bitbucket\
        \ should use when writing the file to disk. When present,\n`filename` takes\
        \ precedence over the value of `Content-ID`.\n\nWhen the JSON body omits the\
        \ `files` element, the remaining parts are\nnot ignored. Instead, each file\
        \ is added to the new snippet as if its\nname was explicitly linked (the use\
        \ of the `files` elements is\nmandatory for some operations like deleting\
        \ or renaming files).\n\n\nmultipart/form-data\n-------------------\n\nThe\
        \ use of JSON for the snippet's meta data is optional. Meta data can\nalso\
        \ be supplied as regular form fields in a more conventional\n`multipart/form-data`\
        \ request:\n\n    $ curl -X POST -u credentials https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets\
        \               -F title=\"My snippet\"               -F file=@foo.txt -F\
        \ file=@image.png\n\n    POST /2.0/snippets HTTP/1.1\n    Content-Length:\
        \ 951\n    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f\n\

        \  ------------------------------63a4b224c59f--\n\nHere the meta data properties\
        \ are included as flat, top-level form\nfields. The file attachments use the\
        \ `file` field name. To attach\nmultiple files, simply repeat the field.\n\
        \nThe advantage of `multipart/form-data` over `multipart/related` is\nthat\
        \ it can be easier to build clients.\n\nEssentially all properties are optional,\
        \ `title` and `files` included.\n\n\nSharing and Visibility\n----------------------\n\
        \nSnippets can be either public (visible to anyone on Bitbucket, as well\n\
        as anonymous users), or private (visible only to the owner, creator\nand members\
        \ of the team in case the snippet is owned by a team). This\nis controlled\
        \ through the snippet's `is_private` element:\n\n* **is_private=false** --\
        \ everyone, including anonymous users can view\n  the snippet\n* **is_private=true**\
        \ -- only the owner and team members (for team\n  snippets) can view it\n\n\
        To create the snippet under a team account, just append the team name\nto\
        \ the URL (see `/2.0/snippets/{username}`)."

        \ on top of the main branch, inheriting the\ncontents of the main branch,\
        \ but adding (or overwriting) the\n`image.png` file to the repository in the\
        \ `/repo/path/to` directory.\n\nThis endpoint accepts `multipart/form-data`\
        \ (as in the example above), as\nwell as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n\
        \n## multipart/form-data\n\nA `multipart/form-data` post contains a series\
        \ of \"form fields\" that\nidentify both the individual files that are being\
        \ uploaded, as well as\nadditional, optional meta data.\n\nFiles are uploaded\
        \ in file form fields (those that have a\n`Content-Disposition` parameter)\
        \ whose field names point to the remote\npath in the repository where the\
        \ file should be stored. Path field\nnames are always interpreted to be absolute\
        \ from the root of the\nrepository, regardless whether the client uses a leading\
        \ slash (as the\nabove `curl` example did).\n\nFile contents are treated as\
        \ bytes and are not decoded as text.\n\nThe commit message, as well as other\
        \ non-file meta data for the\nrequest, is sent along as normal form field\
        \ elements. Meta data fields\nshare the same namespace as the file objects.\
        \ For `multipart/form-data`\nbodies that should not lead to any ambiguity,\
        \ as the\n`Content-Disposition` header will contain the `filename` parameter\
        \ to\ndistinguish between a file named \"message\" and the commit message\
        \ field.\n\n## application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nIt is also possible to\
        \ upload new files using a simple\n`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST.\
        \ This can be convenient when\nuploading pure text files:\n\n```\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/\
        \ \\\n  --data-urlencode \"/path/to/me.txt=Lorem ipsum.\" \\\n  --data-urlencode\
        \ \"message=Initial commit\" \\\n  --data-urlencode \"author=Erik van Zijst\
        \ <erik.van.zijst@gmail.com>\"\n```\n\nThere could be a field name clash if\
        \ a client were to upload a file\nnamed \"message\", as this filename clashes\
        \ with the meta data property\nfor the commit message. To avoid this and to\
        \ upload files whose names\nclash with the meta data properties, use a leading\
        \ slash for the files,\ne.g. `curl --data-urlencode \"/message=file contents\"\
        `.\n\nWhen an explicit slash is omitted for a file whose path matches that\
        \ of\na meta data parameter, then it is interpreted as meta data, not as a\n\
        file.\n\n## Executables and links\n\nWhile this API aims to facilitate the\
        \ most common use cases, it is\npossible to perform some more advanced operations\
        \ like creating a new\nsymlink in the repository, or creating an executable\
        \ file.\n\nFiles can be supplied with a `x-attributes` value in the\n`Content-Disposition`\
        \ header. For example, to upload an executable\nfile, as well as create a\
        \ symlink from `README.txt` to `README`:\n\n```\n--===============1438169132528273974==\n\
        Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\"us-ascii\"\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Transfer-Encoding:\
        \ 7bit\nContent-ID: \"bin/shutdown.sh\"\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\
        \ filename=\"shutdown.sh\"; x-attributes:\"executable\"\n\n#!/bin/sh\nhalt\n\
        \n--===============1438169132528273974==\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\"\
        us-ascii\"\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nContent-ID:\
        \ \"/README.txt\"\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"README.txt\"\
        ; x-attributes:\"link\"\n\nREADME\n--===============1438169132528273974==--\n\
        ```\n\nLinks are files that contain the target path and have\n`x-attributes:\"\
        link\"` set.\n\nWhen overwriting links with files, or vice versa, the newly\
        \ uploaded\nfile determines both the new contents, as well as the attributes.\
        \ That\nmeans uploading a file without specifying `x-attributes=\"link\"`\
        \ will\ncreate a regular file, even if the parent commit hosted a symlink\
        \ at\nthe same path.\n\nThe same applies to executables. When modifying an\
        \ existing executable\nfile, the form-data file element must include\n`x-attributes=\"\
        executable\"` in order to preserve the executable status\nof the file.\n\n\
        Note that this API does not support the creation or manipulation of\nsubrepos\
        \ / submodules."

- content: "\n# Authentication methods\n\nThe purpose of this section is to describe\
    \ how to authenticate when making API calls using the Bitbucket REST API.\n\n\
    -----\n\n*On this page*\n\n* [Oauth 2](#oauth-2)\n  * [Making requests](#make-requests)\n\
    \  * [Repository cloning](#repo-clone)\n  * [Refresh tokens](#refresh-tokens)\n\
    * [Scopes](#scopes-bbc)\n* [App passwords](#app-pw)\n* [Basic auth](#basic-auth)\n\
    \n---\n\n# Bitbucket Cloud OAuth 2.0 <a name=\"oauth-2\"></a>\n\nOur OAuth 2 implementation\
    \ is merged in with our existing OAuth 1 in\nsuch a way that existing OAuth 1\
    \ consumers automatically become\nvalid OAuth 2 clients. The only thing you need\
    \ to do is edit your\nexisting consumer and configure a callback URL.\n\nOnce\
    \ that is in place, you'll have the following 2 URLs:\n\n    https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize\n\
    \    https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token\n\nFor obtaining access/bearer\
    \ tokens, we support all 4 of RFC-6749's grant\nflows, plus a custom Bitbucket\
    \ flow for exchanging JWT tokens for access tokens:\n\n\n### 1. Authorization\
    \ Code Grant (4.1)\n\nThe full-blown 3-LO flow. Request authorization from the\
    \ end user by\nsending their browser to:\n\n    https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=code\n\
    \nThe callback includes the `?code={}` query parameter that you can swap\nfor\
    \ an access token:\n\n    $ curl -X POST -u \"client_id:secret\" \\\n      https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token\
    \ \\\n      -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code={code}\n\n\n### 2. Implicit\
    \ Grant (4.2)\n\nThis flow is useful for browser-based add-ons that operate without\
    \ server-side backends.\n\nRequest the end user for authorization by directing\
    \ the browser to:\n\n    https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=token\n\
    \nThat will redirect to your preconfigured callback URL with a fragment\ncontaining\
    \ the access token\n(`#access_token={token}&token_type=bearer`) where your page's\
    \ js can\npull it out of the URL.\n\n\n### 3. Resource Owner Password Credentials\
    \ Grant (4.3)\n\nUseful if you have the end user's password but you want to use\
    \ a more\nsecure end user access token instead. This method will not work when\
    \ the user has two-step verification enabled.\n\n    $ curl -X POST -u \"client_id:secret\"\
    \ \\\n      https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token -d grant_type=password\
    \ \\\n      -d username={username} -d password={password}\n\n\n### 4. Client Credentials\
    \ Grant (4.4)\n\nSomewhat like our existing \"2-LO\" flow for OAuth 1. Obtain\
    \ an access\ntoken that represents not an end user, but the owner of the\nclient/consumer:\n\
    \n    $ curl -X POST -u \"client_id:secret\" \\\n      https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token\
    \ \\\n      -d grant_type=client_credentials\n\n\n### 5. Bitbucket Cloud JWT Grant\
    \ (urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt)\n\nIf your Atlassian Connect add-on uses JWT authentication,\
    \ you can swap a\nJWT for an OAuth access token. The resulting access token represents\
    \ the\naccount for which the add-on is installed.\n\nMake sure you send the JWT\
    \ token in the Authorization request header\nusing the \"JWT\" scheme (case sensitive).\
    \ Note that this custom scheme\nmakes this different from HTTP Basic Auth (and\
    \ so you cannot use \"curl\n-u\").\n\n    $ curl -X POST -H \"Authorization: JWT\
    \ {jwt_token}\" \\\n      https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \\\n\
    \      -d grant_type=urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt\n\n\n## Making Requests <a name=\"\
    make-requests\"></a>\n\nOnce you have an access token, as per RFC-6750, you can\
    \ use it in a request in any of\nthe following ways (in decreasing order of desirability):\n\
    \n1. Send it in a request header: `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`\n2. Include\
    \ it in a (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) POST body as `access_token={access_token}`\n\
    3. Put it in the query string of a non-POST: `?access_token={access_token}`\n\n\
    \n## Repository Cloning <a name=\"repo-clone\"></a>\n\nSince add-ons will not\
    \ be able to upload their own SSH keys to clone\nwith, access tokens can be used\
    \ as Basic HTTP Auth credentials to\nclone securely over HTTPS. This is much like\
    \ GitHub, yet slightly\ndifferent:\n\n    $ git clone https://x-token-auth:{access_token}@bitbucket.org/user/repo.git\n\
    \nThe literal string `x-token-auth` as a substitute for username is\nrequired\
    \ (note the difference with GitHub where the actual token is in\nthe username\
    \ field).\n\n\n## Refresh Tokens <a name=\"refresh-tokens\"></a>\n\nOur access\
    \ tokens expire in one hour. When this happens you'll get 401\nresponses.\n\n\
    Most access tokens grant responses (Implicit and JWT excluded). Therefore, you\
    \ should include a\nrefresh token that can then be used to generate a new access\
    \ token,\nwithout the need for end user participation:\n\n    $ curl -X POST -u\
    \ \"client_id:secret\" \\\n      https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token\
    \ \\\n      -d grant_type=refresh_token -d refresh_token={refresh_token}\n\n\n\
    # Scopes for the Bitbucket Cloud REST API <a name=\"scopes-bbc\"></a>\n\nBitbucket's\
    \ API applies a number of privilege scopes to endpoints. In order to access an\
    \ endpoint, a request will need to have the necessary scopes.\n\nScopes are declared\
    \ in the descriptor as a list of strings, with each string being the name of a\
    \ unique scope.\n\nA descriptor lacking the `scopes` element is implicitly assumed\
    \ to require all scopes and as a result, Bitbucket will require end users authorizing/installing\
    \ the add-on\nto explicitly accept all scopes.\n\nOur best practice suggests you\
    \ add the scopes your add-on needs, but no more than it needs.\n\nInvalid scope\
    \ strings will cause the descriptor to be rejected and the installation to fail.\n\
    \nFollowing is the set of all currently available scopes.\n\n### repository\n\n\
    Gives the add-on read access to all the repositories the authorizing user has\
    \ access to.\nNote that this scope does not give access to a repository's pull\
    \ requests.\n\n* access to the repo's source code\n* clone over https\n* access\
    \ the the file browsing API\n* download zip archives of the repo's contents\n\
    * the ability to view and use the issue tracker on any repo (created issues, comment,\
    \ vote, etc)\n* the ability to view and use the wiki on any repo (create/edit\
    \ pages)\n\n### repository:write\n\nGives the add-on write (not admin) access\
    \ to all the repositories the authorizing user has access to. No distinction is\
    \ made between public or private repos. This scope implies `repository`, which\
    \ does not need to be requested separately.\nThis scope alone does not give access\
    \ to the pull requests API.\n\n* push access over https\n* fork repos\n\n### repository:admin\n\
    \nGives the add-on admin access to all the repositories the authorizing user has\
    \ access to. No distinction is made between public or private repos. This scope\
    \ does not imply `repository` or `repository:write`. It gives access to the admin\
    \ features of a repo only, not direct access to its contents. Of course it can\
    \ be (mis)used to grant read access to another user account who can then clone\
    \ the repo, but repos that need to read of write source code would also request\
    \ explicit read or write.\nThis scope comes with access to the following functionality:\n\
    \n* view and manipulate committer mappings\n* list and edit deploy keys\n* ability\
    \ to delete the repo\n* view and edit repo permissions\n* view and edit branch\
    \ permissions\n* import and export the issue tracker\n* enable and disable the\
    \ issue tracker\n* list and edit issue tracker version, milestones and components\n\
    * enable and disable the wiki\n* list and edit default reviewers\n* list and edit\
    \ repo links (Jira/Bamboo/Custom)\n* list and edit the repository web hooks\n\
    * initiate a repo ownership transfer\n\n### snippet\n\nGives the add-on read access\
    \ to all the snippets the authorizing user has access to.\nNo distinction is made\
    \ between public and private snippets (public snippets are accessible without\
    \ any form of authentication).\n\n* view any snippet\n* create snippet comments\n\
    \n### snippet:write\n\nGives the add-on write access to all the snippets the authorizing\
    \ user can edit.\nNo distinction is made between public and private snippets (public\
    \ snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).\nThis implies the\
    \ Snippet Read scope which does not need to be requested separately.\n\n* edit\
    \ snippets\n* delete snippets\n\n### issue\n\nAbility to interact with issue trackers\
    \ the way non-repo members can.\nThis scope does not imply any other scopes and\
    \ does not give implicit access to the repository the issue is attached to.\n\n\
    * view, list and search issues\n* create new issues\n* comment on issues\n* watch\
    \ issues\n* vote for issues\n\n### issue:write\n\nThis implies `issue`, but adds\
    \ the ability to transition and delete issues.\nThis scope does not imply any\
    \ other scopes and does not give implicit access to the repository the issue is\
    \ attached to.\n\n* transition issues\n* delete issues\n\n### wiki\n\nGives access\
    \ to wikis. No distinction is made between read and write as wikis are always\
    \ editable by anyone.\nThis scope does not imply any other scopes and does not\
    \ give implicit access to the repository the wiki is attached to.\n\n* view wikis\n\
    * create pages\n* edit pages\n* push to wikis\n* clone wikis\n\n### pullrequest\n\
    \nGives the add-on read access to pull requests.\nThis scope implies `repository`,\
    \ giving read access to the pull request's destination repository.\n\n* see and\
    \ list pull requests\n* create and resolve tasks\n\n### pullrequest:write\n\n\
    Implies `pullrequest` but adds the ability to create, merge and decline pull requests.\n\
    This scope implies `repository:write`, giving write access to the pull request's\
    \ destination repository. This is necessary to facilitate merging.\n\n* merge\
    \ pull requests\n* decline pull requests\n* create pull requests\n* comment on\
    \ pull requests\n* approve pull requests\n\n### email\n\nAbility to see the user's\
    \ primary email address. This should make it easier to use Bitbucket Cloud as\
    \ a login provider to add-ons or external applications.\n\n### account\n\nAbility\
    \ to see all the user's account information. Note that this does not include any\
    \ ability to mutate any of the data.\n\n* see all email addresses\n* language\n\
    * location\n* website\n* full name\n* SSH keys\n* user groups\n\n### account:write\n\
    \nAbility to change properties on the user's account.\n\n* delete the authorizing\
    \ user's account\n* manage the user's groups\n* manupilate a user's email addresses\n\
    * change username, display name and avatar\n\n### team\n\nThe ability to find\
    \ out what teams the current user is part of. This is covered by the teams endpoint.\n\
    \n* information about all the groups and teams I am a member or admin of\n\n\n\
    ### team:write\n\nImplies `team`, but adds the ability to manage the teams that\
    \ the authorizing user is an admin on.\n\n* manage team permissions\n\n### webhook\n\
    \nGives access to webhooks. This scope is required for any webhook\nrelated operation.\n\
    \nThis scope gives read access to existing webhook subscriptions on all\nresources\
    \ you can access, without needing further scopes. This means that\na client can\
    \ list all existing webhook subscriptions on repository\n`foo/bar` (assuming the\
    \ principal user has access to this repo). The\nadditional `repository` scope\
    \ is not required for this.\n\nLikewise, existing webhook subscriptions for a\
    \ repo's issue tracker can be\nretrieved without holding the `issue` scope. All\
    \ that is required is the\n`webhook` scope.\n\nHowever, to create a webhook for\
    \ `issue:created`, the client will need to\nhave both the `webhook` as well as\
    \ `issue` scope.\n\n* list webhook subscriptions on any accessible repository,\
    \ user, team, or snippet\n* create/update/delete webhook subscriptions\n\n\n#\
    \ App passwords <a name=\"app-pw\"></a>\n\nApp passwords allow two-step verification\
    \ users to make API calls to their Bitbucket account through apps such as Sourcetree.\n\
    \nSome important points about app passwords:\n\n* You cannot view an app password\
    \ or adjust permissions after you create the app password. Because app passwords\
    \ are encrypted on our database and cannot be viewed by anyone. They are essentially\
    \ designed to be disposable. If you need to change the scopes or lost the password\
    \ just create a new one.\n* You cannot use them to log into your Bitbucket account.\n\
    * You cannot use app passwords to manage team actions.\n\n    App passwords are\
    \ tied to an individual account's credentials and should not be shared. If you're\
    \ sharing your app password you're essentially giving direct, authenticated, access\
    \ to everything that password has been scoped to do with the Bitbucket API's.\n\
    \n* You can use them for API call authentication, even if you don't have two-step\
    \ verification enabled.\n* You can set permission scopes (specific access rights)\
    \ for each app password.\n\n### Create an app password\n\nTo create an app password:\n\
    \n1. Select **Avatar > Bitbucket settings**.\n2. Click **App passwords** in the\
    \ Access management section.\n3. Click **Create app password**.\n4. Give the app\
    \ password a name related to the application that will use the password.\n5. Select\
    \ the specific access and permissions you want this application password to have.\n\
    6. Copy the generated password and either record or paste it into the application\
    \ you want to give access. The password is only displayed this one time.\n\nThat's\
    \ all there is to creating an app password. See your applications documentation\
    \ for how to apply the app password for a specific application.\n\n## Basic auth\
    \ <a name=\"basic-auth\"></a>\n\nBasic HTTP Authentication as per [RFC-2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617)\
    \ (Digest not supported). Note that Basic Auth with username and password as credentials\
    \ is only available on accounts that have 2-factor-auth / 2-step-verification\
    \ disabled. If you use 2fa, you should authenticate using OAuth2 instead.\n"

- content: "\n# Filter and sort API objects\n\nYou can query the 2.0 API for specific\
    \ objects using a simple language which resembles SQL.\n\n---\n**On this page**\n\
    \n* [Supported endpoints](#supp-endpoints)\n* [Operators](#operators)\n* [Data\
    \ types](#data-types)\n* [Querying](#querying)\n    * [Repositoriess](#query-repo)\n\
    \    * [Pull requests](#query-pullreq)\n    * [Issues](#query-issues)\n    * [Refs,\
    \ tags, bookmarks](#query-ref)\n* [Sorting query results](#query-sort)\n\n----\n\
    \n### Supported endpoints <a name=\"supp-endpoints\"></a>\n\nSeveral 2.0 API resources\
    \ that return collections of objects all support a single, shared, generic querying\
    \ language that is used to filter down a result set.\n\nCurrently, the endpoints\
    \ which support filtering and sorting include:\n\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}\n\
    \    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/branches\n\
    \    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/forks\n\
    \    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/src\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/issues\n\
    \    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests\n\nFiltering and sorting\
    \ supports several distinct operators and data types as well as basic features,\
    \ like logical operators (AND, OR) as shown in the following examples:\n\n\t(state\
    \ = \"open\" OR state = \"new\") AND assignee = null\n\treporter.username != \"\
    evzijst\" AND priority >= \"major\"\n\t(title ~ \"unicode\" OR content.raw ~ \"\
    unicode\") AND created_on > 2015-10-04T14:00:00-07:00\n\nFilter queries can be\
    \ added to the URL using the q=<query> query parameter. To sort the response,\
    \ add sort=<field>. Note that the entire query string is put in the q parameter\
    \ and hence needs to be URL-encoded as shown in the following example:\n\n\t/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state=\"\
    new\"&sort=-updated_on\n\n### Operators <a name=\"operators\"></a>\n\nFiltering\
    \ and sorting supports the following operators:\n\n<table class='aui'>\n    <thead>\n\
    \        <tr>\n            <th>Operator</th>\n            <th>Definition</th>\n\

    data-types\"></a>\n\nFiltering and sorting supports the following data types:\n\
    \n<table class='aui'>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Type</th>\n\
    \            <th>Description</th>\n            <th>Example</th>\n        </tr>\n\

    \        <td><b>Null</b></td>\n        <td>to test for the absence of a value</td>\n\
    \        <td><code>null</code></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><b>boolean</b></td>\n\
    \        <td>the unquoted strings true or false</td>\n        <td><code>true,\

    \       <td>an unquoted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\">ISO-8601</a>\
    \ date time string with the timezone offset, milliseconds and entire time component\
    \ being optional</td>\n        <td><code>2015-03-04T14:08:59.123+02:00</code>,\
    \ <code>2015-03-04T14:08:59</code> Date time strings are assumed to be in UTC,\
    \ unless an explicit timezone offset is provided.</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n\
    ## Querying <a name=\"querying\"></a>\n\nObjects can be filtered based on their\
    \ properties. In principle, every element in an object's JSON document can be\
    \ used as a filter criterion.\n\n### Repositories <a name=\"query-repo\"></a>\n\
    \nYou can query the following fields in the repository resource:\n\n    uuid (string)\n\
    \    full_name (string)\n    scm (string)\n    owner (embedded user object)\n\
    \    name (string)\n    description (string)\n    created_on (datetime)\n    updated_on\
    \ (datetime)\n    size (number)\n    language (string)\n    parent (embedded repository\
    \ object)\n    fork_policy (string)\n    is_private (boolean)\n    has_issues\
    \ (boolean)\n    has_wiki (boolean)\n\nFields that contain embedded instances\
    \ of other object types (e.g. owner is an embedded user object, while parent is\
    \ an embedded repository) can be traversed recursively. For instance:\n\n\tparent.owner.username\
    \ = \"bitbucket\"\n\n### Pull Requests <a name=\"query-pullreq\"></a>\n\nYou can\
    \ query the following fields in the pull request resource:\n\n    id (number)\n\
    \    title (string)\n    description (string)\n    author (embedded user object)\n\
    \    reviewers (embedded user object)\n    state (string)\n    source.repository\
    \ (embedded repository object)\n    source.branch.name (string)\n    destination.repository\
    \ (embedded repository object)\n    destination.branch.name (string)\n    close_source_branch\
    \ (boolean)\n    closed_by (embedded user object)\n    reason (string)\n    created_on\
    \ (datetime)\n    updated_on (datetime)\n    task_count (number)\n    comment_count\
    \ (number)\n\n**For example**\n\nTo find pull requests which merge into master,\
    \ come from a fork of the repo rather than a branch inside the repo, and on which\
    \ I am a reviewer:\n\n```\nsource.repository.full_name != \"main/repo\" AND state\
    \ = \"OPEN\" AND reviewers.username = \"evzijst\" AND destination.branch.name\
    \ = \"master\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/main/repo/pullrequests?q=source.repository.full_name+%21%3D+%22main%2Frepo%22+AND+state+%3D+%22OPEN%22+AND+reviewers.username+%3D+%22evzijst%22+AND+destination.branch.name+%3D+%22master%22\n\
    ```\n\n### Issues <a name=\"query-issues\"></a>\n\nYou can query the following\
    \ fields in the issues resource:\n\n    id (number)\n    title (string)\n    reporter\
    \ (embedded user object)\n    assignee (embedded user object)\n    content.raw\
    \ (string)\n    created_on (datetime)\n    updated_on (datetime)\n    state (string)\n\
    \    kind (string)\n    priority (string)\n    version (string)\n    component\
    \ (string)\n    milestone (string)\n    watches (number)\n    votes (number)\n\
    \n**For example**\n\nTo find new or on-hold issues related to the UI, created\
    \ or updated in the last day (SF local time), that have not yet been assigned\
    \ to anyone:\n\n```\n(state = \"new\" OR state = \"on hold\") AND assignee = null\

- content: "\n# Pagination\n\nEndpoints that return collections of objects should\
    \ always apply pagination.\nPaginated collections are always wrapped in the following\
    \ wrapper object:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"size\": 5421,\n  \"page\": 2,\n  \"pagelen:\
    \ 10,\n  \"next\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=3\"\
    ,\n  \"previous\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=1\"\
    ,\n  \"values\": [\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nPagination is often page-bound, with\
    \ a query parameter page indicating which\npage is to be returned.\n\nHowever,\
    \ clients are not expected to construct URLs themselves by manipulating\nthe page\
    \ number query parameter. Instead, the response contains a link to the\nnext page.\
    \ This link should be treated as an opaque location that is not to be\nconstructed\
    \ by clients or even assumed to be predictable. The only contract\naround the\
    \ next link is that it will return the next chunk of results.\n\nLack of a next\
    \ link in the response indicates the end of the collection.\n\nThe paginated response\
    \ contains the following fields:\n\n<table class='aui'>\n    <thead>\n       \
    \ <tr>\n            <th>Field</th>\n            <th>Value</th>\n        </tr>\n\
    \    </thead>\n    <tr>\n        <td><code>size</code></td>\n        <td>Total\
    \ number of objects in the response. This is an optional element that is not provided\
    \ in all responses, as it can be expensive to compute. </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n\
    \        <td><code>page</code></td>\n        <td>Page number of the current results.\
    \ This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses.</td>\n  \
    \  </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><code>pagelen</code></td>\n        <td>Current\
    \ number of objects on the existing page. Globally, the minimum length is 10 and\
    \ the maximum is 100. Some APIs may specify a different default.</td>\n    </tr>\n\
    \    <tr>\n        <td><code>next</code></td>\n        <td>Link to the next page\
    \ if it exists. The last page of a collection does not have this value. Use this\
    \ link to navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs.</td>\n\
    \    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><code>previous</code></td>\n        <td>Link\
    \ to previous page if it exists. A collections first page does not have this value.\
    \ This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses. Some result\
    \ sets strictly support forward navigation and never provide previous links. Clients\
    \ must anticipate that backwards navigation is not always available.\n       \
    \ Use this link to navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your\
    \ own URLs.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><code>values</code></td>\n\
    \        <td>The list of objects. This contains at most <code>pagelen</code> objects.</td>\n\
    \    </tr>\n</table>\n\nThe link to the next page is included such that you don't\
    \ have to hardcode or construct any links.  Only values and next are guaranteed\
    \ (except the last page, which lacks next). This is because the previous and size\
    \ values can be expensive for some data sets.\n\nIt is important to realize that\
    \ Bitbucket support both list-based pagination and iterator-based pagination.\
    \ List-based pagination assumes that the collection is a discrete, immutable,\
    \ consistently ordered, finite array of objects with a fixed size. Clients navigate\
    \ a list-based collection by requesting offset-based chunks. In Bitbucket Cloud,\
    \ list-based responses include the optional size, page, and previous element.\
    \ The the next and previous links typically resemble something like /foo/bar?page=4.\n\
    \nHowever, not all result sets can be treated as immutable and finite â€“ much like\
    \ how programming languages tend to distinguish between lists and arrays on one\
    \ hand and iterators or stream on the other. Where an list-based pagination offers\
    \ random access into any point in a collection, iterator-based pagination can\
    \ only navigate forward one element at a time. In Bitbucket such iterator-based\
    \ pagination contains the next link and pagelen elements, but not necessarily\
    \ anything else. In these cases, the next link's value often contains an unpredictable\
    \ hash instead of an explicit page number. The commits resource uses iterator-based\
    \ pagination.\n"

- content: "\n# Partial responses\n\nBy default, each endpoint returns the full representation\
    \ of a resource and in\nsome cases that can be a lot of data. For example, retrieving\
    \ a list of pull\nrequests can amount to quite a large document.\n\nFor better\
    \ performance, you can ask the server to only return the fields you\nreally need\
    \ and to omit unwanted data. To request a partial response and to\nadd or remove\
    \ specific fields from a response, use the `fields` query\nparameter.\n\n\n##\
    \ Example\n\nMost API resources embed a substantial list of links pointing to\
    \ related\nresources. This saves the client from constructing its own URLs, but\
    \ is\nsomewhat wasteful when the client doesn't need them.\n\nTo significantly\
    \ reduce the size of the response, use `?fields=-links`:\n\n```\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links\n\
    {\n  \"username\": \"evzijst\",\n  \"website\": \"\",\n  \"display_name\": \"\
    Erik van Zijst\",\n  \"uuid\": \"{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}\",\n \
    \ \"created_on\": \"2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00\",\n  \"location\": null,\n  \"\
    type\": \"user\"\n}\n```\n\n## Fields parameter syntax\n\nThe `fields` parameter\
    \ supports 3 modes of operation:\n\n1. Removal of select fields (e.g. `-links`)\n\
    2. Pulling in additional fields not normally returned by an endpoint, while\n\
    \   still getting all the default fields (e.g. `+reviewers`)\n3. Omitting all\
    \ fields, except those specified (e.g. `owner.username`)\n\nThe fields parameter\
    \ can contain a list of multiple comma-separated field names\n(e.g. `fields=owner.username,uuid,links.self.href`).\
    \ The parameter itself is\nnot repeated.\n\nAs discussed at [Condensed Versus\
    \ Full Objects](serialization#representations),\nmost objects that are embedded\
    \ inside other objects (like how `owner` is an\nembedded `user` object in `repository`)\
    \ appear in \"condensed\" form that omits\nmany fields. The `fields` parameter\
    \ allows us to pull in additional fields in\nsuch cases.\n\nFor example, the embedded\
    \ repository object in a pull request does not normally\ncontain its `owner`.\
    \ To add that in we can use:\n`+values.destination.repository.owner`.\n\n\n##\
    \ Wildcards\n\nThe asterisk can be used to match all fields on a particular level.\
    \ For\nexample, removing all entries from the `links` element can be done like\
    \ this:\n\n```\n$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links.*\n\
    {\n  \"username\": \"evzijst\",\n  \"website\": \"\",\n  \"display_name\": \"\
    Erik van Zijst\",\n  \"uuid\": \"{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}\",\n \
    \ \"links\": {},\n  \"created_on\": \"2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00\",\n  \"location\"\
    : null,\n  \"type\": \"user\"\n}\n```\n\nWildcards can be used in combination\
    \ with exclusion and inclusion. For\ninstance, `-*,+foo,+bar` will remove all\
    \ elements from the root level and then\nadd in `foo` and `bar`.\n\n\n## URL encoding\n\
    \nBe aware that when using the `+foo.bar` syntax in the query string, that the\n\
    \"+\" must be URL encoded as \"%2B\" and so the URL will be:\n\n```\nhttps://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/interruptingcow?fields=%2Bowner.created_on\n\
    ```\n\nWithout URL escaping, \"+\" is interpreted as an encoded space which will\
    \ not\nmatch any fields.\n\n\n## Field discovery\n\nWhile a resource's `self`\
    \ URL, as well its \"collection\" URL typically return\nthe full object with all\
    \ its fields, there are some exceptions for fields that\nare overly verbose or\
    \ costly to generate.\n\nFor instance, a pull request contains the embedded lists\
    \ of reviewers and\nparticipants. These fields are included from the `self` URL,\
    \ but not from the\n`/pullrequests` collections resource, as it would impact performance\
    \ too much.\n\nTo discover any additional fields that might not be included by\
    \ default,\n`fields=*` can be used.\n\n\n## More examples\n\nIf we want to get\
    \ a list of all reviewer usernames on pull requests I created,\nwe could combine\
    \ a [filter](filtering) with a partial response. This will omit\nall other data\
    \ from the response:\n\n```\n/2.0/repositories/bitbucket/bitbucket/pullrequests?fields=values.id,values.reviewers.username,values.state&q=author.username%3D%22erik%22\n\
    {\n  \"values\": [\n    {\n      \"reviewers\": [\n        {\n          \"username\"\
    : \"abhin\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"username\": \"dtao\"\n       \
    \ },\n        {\n          \"username\": \"csomme\"\n        }\n      ],\n   \
    \   \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"id\": 11355\n    },\n    {\n      \"reviewers\"\
    : [\n        {\n          \"username\": \"csomme\"\n        },\n        {\n  \
    \        \"username\": \"abhin\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"username\"\
    : \"dstevens\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"state\": \"MERGED\",\n      \"id\"\
    : 11347\n    },\n    {\n      \"reviewers\": [\n        {\n          \"username\"\
    : \"csomme\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"username\": \"jmooring\"\n  \
    \      },\n        {\n          \"username\": \"zdavis\"\n        },\n       \

    : \"OPEN\",\n      \"id\": 11344\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n"

    \ page*\n\n* [Open API Specification](#oai)\n* [JSON Schema](#jsonschema)\n* [Condensed\
    \ Versus Full Objects](#representations)\n\n____\n\n\n## Open API Specification\
    \ <a name=\"aoi\"></a>\n\nBitbucket uses the [Open API Specification](https://openapis.org)\
    \ (OAI,\nformerly known as Swagger) to describe its APIs. Our OAI specification\
    \ schema\nis hosted at [https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json](https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json)\n\
    and serves as the canonical definition and comprehensive declaration of all\n\
    available endpoints.\n\nThe OAI specification makes writing client applications\
    \ easier by:\nauto-generating boilerplate code (like data object classes) and\
    \ dealing with\nauthentication and error handling.\n\nYou can find a comprehensive\
    \ set of open tools for the OAI specification at:\n[https://github.com/swagger-api](https://github.com/swagger-api).\n\
    \n\n## JSON Schema <a name=\"jsonschema\"></a>\n\nBitbucket uses JSON Schema to\
    \ describe the layout of every type of object\nconsumed or produced by the API.\
    \ These schemas are collected under the\n`#definitions` element of our swagger.json\
    \ file.\n\nWhen an endpoint expects an object as part of a POST or PUT, it also\
    \ expects\nthe object to validate against the JSON schemas. The same applies to\
    \ objects\nreturned by an endpoint.\n\n\n## Condensed Versus Full Objects <a name=\"\
    representations\"></a>\n\nMost objects in Bitbucket come both in \"full\" and\
    \ \"partial\" representation.\nThe full representation is when all elements are\
    \ included. This is the layout\nreturned by a resource's `self` location (e.g.\
    \ `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar`),\nas well as resource collection endpoints (e.g.\
    \ `/2.0/repositories`).\n\nHowever, Bitbucket objects often embed other objects.\
    \ For example, a `repository`\nobject embeds a `user` object for its owner. Likewise,\
    \ a `pullrequest` object\nembeds its `repository` object.\n\nThese related objects\
    \ are embedded, or inlined, to reduce the \"chatter\" when\nclients make frequent\
    \ followup API calls to collect information on common,\nrelated information.\n\
    \nEmbedded related objects are typically limited in their fields to avoid such\n\
    object graphs from becoming too deep and noisy. They often exclude their own\n\
    nested objects in an attempt to strike a balance between performance and\nutility.\n\
    \nAn object's embedded or condensed representation tends to be standardized,\n\
    meaning the fields included is the same set, regardless of where the object\n\
    was embedded.\n"

- content: "\n# URI, UUID, and structures\n\nYou should be familiar with REST architecture\
    \ before writing an integration. Read this overview page to gain a good understanding\
    \ of Bitbucket's REST implementation.\n\n----\n**On this page**\n\n* [URI structure](#uri-structure)\n\
    * [HTTP methods](#http-methods)\n* [UUID](#uuid)\n    * [User object and UUID](#userobj)\n\
    \    * [Repository object and UUID](#repo-obj)\n    * [Team object and UUID](#teamobj)\n\
    * [Standard error repsponses](#stand-error)\n* [Standard ISO-8601 timestamps](#timestamp)\n\
    \n----\n\n\n## URI structure <a name=\"uri-structure\"></a>\n\nAll Bitbucket Cloud\
    \ requests start with the `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0` prefix (for the 2.0\
    \ API) and `https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0` prefix (1.0 API).\n\nThe next segment\
    \ of the URI path depends on the endpoint of the request. For example, using the\
    \ curl command and the repositories endpoint you can list all the issues on Bitbucket's\
    \ tutorial repository:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org\n\
    ```\nGiven a specific endpoint, you can then drill down to a particular aspect\
    \ or resource of that endpoint. The issues resource on a repository is an example:\n\
    \n```\ncurl https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org/issues\n\
    ```\n### HTTP methods <a name=\"http-methods\"></a>\nA given endpoint or resource\
    \ has a series of actions (or methods) associated with it. The Bitbucket service\
    \ supports these standard HTTP methods:\n\n<table class='aui'>\n    <thead>\n\
    \        <tr>\n            <th>Call</th>\n            <th>Description</th>\n \
    \       </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tr>\n        <td>GET</td>\n        <td>Retrieves\
    \ information.  </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>PUT</td>\n        <td>Updates\
    \ existing information.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>POST</td>\n   \
    \     <td>Creates new information.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>DELETE</td>\n\
    \        <td>Removes existing information.</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\nFor example,\
    \ you can call use the POST action on the issues resource and create an issue\
    \ on the issue tracker.\n\n**Specifying content length**\n\nYou can get a `411\
    \ Length Required` response. If this happens, the API requires a Content-Length\
    \ header but the client is not sending it. You should add the header yourself,\
    \ for example using the curl client:\n\n```\ncurl -r PUT --header \"Content-Length:\
    \ 0\" -u user:pass https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/emails/rap@atlassian.com\n```\n\
    ## Universally Unique Identifier <a name=\"uuid\"></a>\n\nUUID's provide a single\
    \ point of recognition for users, teams, and repositories. The UUID is distinct\
    \ from the username, team name, and repository name fields and remains the same\
    \ even when those fields change. For example when a user changes their username\
    \ or moves a repository you will need to modify calls which use those identifiers\
    \ but not if you are pointing to the UUID.\n\n### UUID examples and structure\n\
    \nUUID's work with both the 1.0 and 2.0 APIs for the user, team, and repository\
    \ objects. The following examples the following characters are replacements for\
    \ curly brackets: `%7B` replaces `{`  and `%7D` replaces `}`. You will see this\
    \ structure in the following example sections.\n\n### User object and UUID <a\

    \ Supported content types <a name=\"supported-content\"></a>\n\nThe default and\
    \ primary content type for 2.0 APIs is JSON. This applies both to responses from\
    \ the server and to the request bodies provided by the client.\n\nUnless documented\
    \ otherwise, whenever creating a new (POST) or modifying an existing (PUT) object,\
    \ your client must provide the object's normal representation. Not every object\
    \ element can be mutated. For example, a repository's created_on date is an auto-generated,\
    \ immutable field. Your client can omit immutable fields from a request body.\n\
    \nIn some cases, a resource might also accept regular application/x-www-url-form-encoded\
    \ POST and PUT bodies. Such bodies can be more convenient in scripts and command\
    \ line usage. Requests bodies can contain contain nested elements or they can\
    \ be flat (without nested elements). Clients can send flat request bodies as either\
    \ as application/json or as application/x-www-url-form-encoded. Nested objects\
    \ always require JSON.\n\n## Resource links <a name=\"resource-links\"></a>\n\n\
    Every 2.0 object contains a links element that points to related resources or\
    \ alternate representations. Use links to quickly discover and traverse to related\
    \ objects. Links serve a \"self-documenting\" function for each endpoint. For\
    \ example, the following request for a specific user:\n\n\n`$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials`\n\
    \n```json\n{\n    \"username\": \"tutorials\",\n    \"website\": \"https://tutorials.bitbucket.org/\"\
    ,\n    \"display_name\": \"tutorials account\",\n    \"uuid\": \"{c788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007}\"\
    ,\n    \"links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials\"\
    \n        },\n        \"repositories\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials\"\
    \n        },\n        \"html\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket.org/tutorials\"\
    \n        },\n        \"followers\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/followers\"\
    \n        },\n        \"avatar\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://bitbucket-assetroot.s3.amazonaws.com/c/photos/2013/Nov/25/tutorials-avatar-1563784409-6_avatar.png\"\
    \n        },\n        \"following\": {\n            \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/following\"\
    \n        }\n    },\n    \"created_on\": \"2011-12-20T16:34:07.132459+00:00\"\
    ,\n    \"location\": \"Santa Monica, CA\",\n    \"type\": \"user\"\n}\n```\nLinks\
    \ can be actual REST API resources or they can be informational. In this example,\
    \ informative resources include the user's avatar and the HTML URL for the user's\
    \ Bitbucket account. Your client should avoid hardcoding an API's URL and instead\
    \ use the URLs returned in API responses.\n\nA link's key is its `rel` (relationship)\
    \ attribute and it contains a mandatory href element. For example, the following\
    \ link:\n\n```json\n\"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials\"\
    \n}\n```\n\nThe rel for this link is self and the href is https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials.\
    \ A single rel key can contain an list (array) of href objects. Your client should\
    \ anticipate that any rel key can contain one or more href objects.\n\nFinally,\
    \ links can also contain optional elements. Two common optional elements are the\
    \ name element and the title element. They are often used to disambiguate links\
    \ that share the same rel key. In the example below, the repository object that\
    \ contains a clone link with two href objects. Each object contains the optional\
    \ name element to clarify its use.\n\n```json\n\"links\": {\n  \"self\": {\n \
    \   \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/bitbucket\"\
    \n  },\n  \"clone\": [\n    {\n      \"href\": \"https://api.bitbucket.org/evzijst/bitbucket.git\"\
    ,\n      \"name\": \"https\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"href\": \"ssh://git@bitbucket.org/erik/bitbucket.git\"\
    ,\n      \"name\": \"ssh\"\n    }\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n```\nLinks can support [URI\
    \ Templates](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570); Those that do contain a `\"\
    templated\": \"true\"` element.\n"
